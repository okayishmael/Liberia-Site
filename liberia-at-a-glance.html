						diplomatically trotted the world going as far as Slovenia, Spain, Guinea, La Cote d’Ivoire,
						Ethiopia, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, Belgium, and the Netherlands among others.
					</p>

					<p>There are 16 ethnic groups that make up Liberia’s indigenous population. The Kpelle in central
						and
						western Liberia is the largest ethnic group. Americo-Liberians who are descendants of freed
						slaves
						that arrived in Liberia early in 1821 make up an estimated 5% of the population.
					</p>
					<p>There also are sizable numbers of Lebanese, Indians, and other West African nationals who make up
						a
						significant part of Liberia’s business community. The Liberian constitution restricts
						citizenship
						only to people of Negro descent; also, land ownership is restricted by law to citizens.
						Liberia was traditionally noted for its hospitality and academic institutions, iron mining and
						rubber industry booms, and cultural skills and arts and craft works. But political upheavals
						beginning in the 1980s and the brutal 14-year civil war (1989-2003) brought about a steep
						decline in
						the living standards of the country, including its education and infrastructure.</p>

				<div class="panel">

					<p>GDP (IMF 2005 est.): $548.4million.Real GDP growth rate (2004): 2.0%.Per capita GDP (2005):
						$119.4.Consumer Price Index (2004): 7.0%.Natural resources: Iron ore, rubber, timber, diamonds,
						gold
						and tin. The Government of Liberia has reported in recent years that it has discovered sizable
						deposits of crude oil along its Atlantic Coast.Agriculture: Products–coffee, cocoa, sugarcane,
						rice,
						cassava, palm oil, bananas, plantains, citrus, pineapple, sweet potatoes, corn, and
						vegetables.Industry: Types–agriculture, iron ore, rubber, forestry, diamonds, gold, beverages,
						construction. Trade (2004): Exports–$103.8 million: rubber 93%; cocoa 3.5%. Major
						markets–Germany,
						Poland, U.S., Greece. Imports–$268.1 million: mineral fuels and lubricants; food and live
						animals;
						machinery and transport equipment; manufactured goods; pharmaceuticals; and tobacco.</p>

					<p>The Liberian economy relied heavily on the mining of iron ore and on the export of natural rubber
						prior to the civil war. Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. In the
						1970s
						and 1980s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia’s export earnings. Following the
						coup
						d’etat of 1980, the country’s economic growth rate slowed down because of a decline in the
						demand
						for iron ore on the world market and political upheavals in Liberia. Liberia’s foreign debt
						amounts
						to about $3.5 billion.</p>

					<p>The 1989-2003 civil war had a devastating effect on the country’s economy. Most major businesses
						were
						destroyed or heavily damaged, and most foreign investors and businesses left the country.</p>

					<p>As the second-largest maritime licenser in the world–with more than 1,800 vessels registered
						under
						its flag, including 35% of the world’s tanker fleet–Liberia earns some $14 million annually from
						the
						flag registry. There is increasing interest in the possibility of commercially exploitable
						offshore
						crude oil deposits along Liberia’s Atlantic Coast.</p>

					<p>Liberia’s business sector is largely controlled by foreigners, mainly of Lebanese and Indian
						descent.
						There also are limited numbers of Chinese engaged in agriculture. There also are significant
						numbers
						of West Africans engaged in cross-border trade.</p>

					<p>Liberia is a member of ECOWAS. With Guinea and Sierra Leone, it formed the Mano River Union (MRU)
						for
						development and the promotion of regional economic integration. The MRU became all but defunct
						because of the Liberian civil war, which spilled over into neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea.
						There was some revival of MRU political and security cooperation discussions in 2002.
						With a new, democratically elected government in place since January 2006, Liberia seeks to
						reconstruct its shattered economy. The Governance and Economic Management Program (GEMAP), which
						started under the 2003-2006 transitional government, is designed to help the Liberian Government
						raise and spend revenues in an efficient, transparent way. Success under GEMAP and solid
						economic
						performance should result in Liberia being able to attract investment and begin rebuilding its
						economy.</p>

				<button class="accordion">Current Economy</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The Liberian economy had relied heavily on the mining of iron ore prior to the civil war. Liberia
						was
						a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. In the 1970s and 1980s, iron mining accounted
						for
						more than half of Liberia's export earnings. Since the coup d'état of 1980, the country's
						economic
						growth rate has slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world market
						and
						political upheavals in Liberia. Liberia's foreign debt amounts to more than $3 billion.</p>

					<p>Timber and rubber are Liberia's main export items since the end of the war. Liberia earns more
						than
						$100 million and more than $70 million annually from timber and rubber exports, respectively.
						Alluvial diamond and gold mining activities also account for some economic activity.</p>

					<p>Being the second-largest maritime licenser in the world with more than 1,700 vessels registered
						under
						its flag, including 35% of the world's tanker fleet, Liberia earned more than $18 million from
						its
						maritime program in 2000. The Liberian Government has declared in recent months that it has
						discovered sizable amounts of crude oil along its Atlantic coast.</p>

					<p>Liberia's business sector is largely controlled by foreigners mainly of Lebanese and Indian
						descent.
						There also are limited numbers of Chinese engaged in agriculture. The largest timber concession,
						Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), is Indonesian owned. There also are significant numbers of
						West
						Africans engaged in cross-border trade.Liberia is a member of the Economic Community of West
						African
						States (ECOWAS). With Guinea and Sierra Leone, it formed the Mano River Union (MRU) for
						development
						and the promotion of regional economic integration. The MRU became all but defunct because of
						the
						Liberian civil war which spilled over into neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p>

					<p>Liberia has relied heavily on vast amounts of foreign assistance, particularly from the United
						States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the People's Republic of China, and Romania. But
						because of the Liberian Government's perceived disregard for human rights, foreign assistance to
						Liberia has declined drastically. The Republic of China (Taiwan) and Libya are currently the
						largest
						donors of direct financial aid to the Liberian Government. However, significant amounts of aid
						continue to come in from Western countries through international aid agencies and
						non-governmental
						organizations, avoiding direct aid to the government.</p>

					<p>The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia in May 2001 for its support to the rebels of the
						Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in neighboring Sierra Leone.Unlike almost all other countries
						in
						the world, Liberia has not adopted the metric system as its primary system of measurement.In
						March
						2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the first hotel constructed in Liberia in 20 years.
						The
						13-acre (53,000 m2) luxury resort was built in the Paynesville section of Monrovia.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Foreign Relations</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Liberia has maintained traditionally cordial relations with the West. China and Libya have been
						prominent international partners in Liberia's reconstruction. Liberia also maintains diplomatic
						relations with Cuba.</p>

					<p>Liberia is a founding member of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and is a member
						of
						the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African
						Development Bank (ADB), the Mano River Union (MRU), and the Non-Aligned Movement.Liberia has
						taken
						steps to forge closer ties with Western countries, especially the United States. President Ellen
						Johnson Sirleaf has visited several Western countries, including the United Kingdom, Sweden,
						Norway,
						Spain, France, and Germany. President Johnson Sirleaf has also visited China and Libya.</p>

					<p>The political impasse in Cote d’Ivoire over the November 28, 2010 presidential elections prompted
						more than 140,000 people to cross into Liberia as refugees. They inhabit the border region and
						belong to rival ethnic groups generally perceived as having supported either the legitimately
						elected president, Alassane Ouattara, or former president Laurent Gbagbo. Although the Ivoirian
						political stalemate has since been resolved, the humanitarian crisis affecting both the refugees
						and
						the receiving communities has lingered. Liberia’s coordination of, and support for,
						international
						relief efforts has been welcome.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">U.S.- Liberia Relations</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Congress appropriated $100,000 in 1819 for the establishment of Liberia (and resettlement of
						freemen
						and freed slaves from North America) by the American Colonization Society, led by prominent
						Americans such as Francis Scott Key, George Washington's nephew Bushrod, Henry Clay, Daniel
						Webster,
						and Presidents Monroe (for whom Liberian settlers named the capital, Monrovia), Adams, and
						Jackson.
						The first group of settlers arrived in Liberia from the United States in the 1820s. The United
						States, which officially recognized Liberia in 1862, shared particularly close relations with
						Liberia during the Cold War.</p>

					<p>The outbreak of civil war in Liberia and the long dominance of Charles Taylor soured bilateral
						relations. However, Liberia now counts the United States as its strongest supporter in its
						democratization and reconstruction efforts. Since the end of Liberia's civil war in 2003, the
						United
						States has contributed over $1 billion in bilateral assistance and more than $1 billion in
						assessed
						contributions to the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). In February 2008, President George W. Bush
						visited Liberia, where he held his fourth one-on-one meeting with President Johnson Sirleaf
						since
						her inauguration in January 2006. Peace Corps volunteers returned to Liberia in 2008 for the
						first
						time since 1990. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid an official visit to Liberia in August
						2009. President Johnson Sirleaf met President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton in Washington
						in
						May 2010.</p>

					<p>In Monrovia, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implements its second-largest
						development program in Africa. USAID's post-conflict rebuilding strategy focuses on
						reintegration
						and is increasingly moving toward a longer-term development focus. Rehabilitation efforts
						include
						national and community infrastructure projects, such as expanding access to electricity,
						building
						roads, refurbishing government buildings, training Liberians in vocational skills, promoting
						business development, and improving livelihoods while protecting Liberia's forests. USAID also
						funds
						basic education programs, improving education for children, focusing on girls, and training
						teachers. USAID programs also include primary health care clinics, HIV/AIDS prevention, and a
						large
						malaria program. Further, USAID supports rule of law programs, establishing legal aid clinics
						and
						victim abuse centers, training judges and lawyers, community peace building and reconciliation
						efforts, and anti-corruption projects to promote transparency and accountability in public
						sector
						entities. USAID is also providing support to strengthen the legislative and other political
						processes, and is strengthening civil society's role in delivering services and advocating good
						governance. U.S. bilateral assistance totaled almost $230 million in FY 2010. In July 2010, the
						Government of Liberia signed a $15 million Threshold Program with the Millennium Challenge
						Corporation to strengthen indicators in land reform, girl’s education, and trade.</p>
